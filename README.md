## Tutorial Schedule
- **Tutorial sheets** will be uploaded on the course **MOODLE** (and this webpage) a week prior to the tutorial session.  

- Each sheet will be divided into **Part-A** and **Part-B**:  
  - **Part-A:**  
    Solutions will be uploaded on MOODLE (and this webpage) along with the tutorial sheet.  
    Students are required to review both the problems **AND** their solutions **before attending the tutorials**.  
    Come prepared to discuss any doubts with the tutorial teachers.  
  - **Part-B:**  
    This section contains the homework assignments.  
    Please do not ask **tutorial teachers to provide solutions or hints for Part-B** during the tutorials (or even outside of tutorials).  
    You are encouraged to work independently on these assignments to enhance your learning.  

- **Additional Requirements:**  
  Students must bring the relevant text/problem sets and a calculator to every tutorial session.

## Course References
This course is based on three textbooks:
* **Course Textbook**: "Engineering Mechanics" by P. C. Dumir, S. Sengupta, and S. V. Veeravalli, Universities Press, 2020.
*	"Vector Mechanics for Engineers, Statics & Dynamics" by F. P. Beer et al. McGraw Hill, 7th Ed. 2005
*	"Engineering Mechanics, Statics and Dynamics" by I.H. Shames, Prentice Hall, (Third or Fourth edition).
  
*Use the last two reference books for practicing problem-solving. The notation/development followed in the reference books is very different from that of the main text and our lectures. It is mandatory that all students follow the notation used in lecture notes in all exams/quizzes/tutorial sessions. The use of any other notation leads to massive confusion and ambiguity.* **If you do not follow the notations used in the lecture notes, your work will not be evaluated.**

## Grading  
A single make-up exam will be arranged for students who miss the minor exam due to medical reasons. **Only medical certificates issued by the IIT Hospital will be accepted.** The best two out of three quizzes will be counted. There will be no re-quiz for a missed quiz. 

To earn an A grade, a student must have more than 80% marks **AND** must be within the top 10% of the class. Below 30% will be an F grade.  All exams, quizzes, and final grading will be common for the Morning and Afternoon batches. 


|Component|Scores| Solutions | 
|:---|:-----|:------:|
|**Quiz #1**| 10 |  |
|**Minor**| 30 | [Sol](Exams/MinorSol24.pdf) |
|**Quiz #2**| 10 |  |
|**Quiz #3**| 10 |  |
|**Major**| 40 | [Sol](Exams/MajorSolF24.pdf)|
|**Tutorial Attendance**| 10 | [Tut Attd](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PAtiBWz4vaXzsIcjFU2ygSceUVB-LaV930WQqWWMIwE/edit?gid=0#gid=0)|
|**Total** |100| |

## Lecture Attendance
Students are required to maintain a minimum attendance of 75% in lecture classes. If a student's lecture attendance falls below 75%, their grade in the course may be reduced, in line with the institute's policy on attendance. Any student who is caught signing on the attendance sheet for another student in any lecture/tutorial session will get a zero on the tutorial attendance part (zero on 10%).

## Miscellaneous Information
*	Cases of plagiarism will be dealt with sternly, and all parties involved will receive identical punishment. Finding any evidence of plagiarism will lead to zero being awarded to all parties on that entire exam.

* Classroom doors close at 2:05 PM. If you arrive after the classroom door has been closed, do not knock and disturb, **just leave**. 

* All course-related material (including lecture notes) will be uploaded to this website and the Moodle course page. Some short-notice announcements may also be posted on this page. Your IITD email will be used to broadcast short-notice announcements. Students are advised to frequently (i) visit the Moodle course webpage, and (ii) their IITD mail inbox for the up-to-date information/activities related to this course.
